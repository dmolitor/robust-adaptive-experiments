# Robust Adaptive Experiments


The goal of these simulations is to demonstrate how we can design
adaptive experiments that are well-powered and allow anytime-valid
causal inference. Within this framework we can design experiments that
achieve the following goals:

- Any-time valid inference on the ATE; this allows us to stop the
  experiment when statistically significant ATEs are detected.
- Dynamic sample allocation that ensures sufficient sample size to be
  well-powered in all treatment arms.
- Incorporates efficiency gains via the bandit design (e.g.Â welfare
  boost or reward maximization).

## MAD

The MAD design mixes some Bernoulli randomization with arbitrary MAB
algorithms allowing unbiased ATE estimation with anytime-valid
Confidence Sequences (CS).

The following simple example demonstrates the usefulness of the MAD
design. We will simulate a experiment with a control arm and a treatment
arm. The outcomes from the control arm are sampled
~Bernoulli($\theta=0.5$) and the treatment arm are sampled
~Bernoulli($\theta=0.6$) for an ATE = $0.1$. The bandit algorithm used
here is Thompson Sampling and the experiment will stop as soon as a
statistically significant ATE has been detected.

``` python
generator = np.random.default_rng(seed=123)

def reward_fn(arm: int) -> float:
    values = {
        0: generator.binomial(1, 0.5),
        1: generator.binomial(1, 0.6)
    }
    return values[arm]

exp_simple = MAD(
    bandit=TSBernoulli(k=2, control=0, reward=reward_fn),
    alpha=0.05,
    delta=lambda x: 1./(x**0.24),
    t_star=int(20e3)
)
exp_simple.fit(cs_precision=0)
```

We can demonstrate that the MAD design gives us an unbiased estimate of
the ATE with valid CSs that converge to the truth and are valid across
time.

``` python
(
    exp_simple.plot()
    + pn.coord_cartesian(ylim=(-.5, 1.5))
    + pn.geom_hline(
        mapping=pn.aes(yintercept="ate", color="factor(arm)"),
        data=pd.DataFrame({"arm": list(range(1, 2)), "ate": [0.1]}),
        linetype="dotted"
    )
    + pn.theme(strip_text=pn.element_blank()) 
).show()
```
