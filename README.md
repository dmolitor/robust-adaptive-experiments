# Robust Adaptive Experiments

This project aims to develop methods for designing adaptive experiments that ensure valid treatment effect inference while maintaining sufficient power to detect effects across all treatment arms, including suboptimal ones.

## Replications

Below are instructions for replicating tables/figures for various conference
or journal submissions. To install necessary dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### $\text{IC}^2\text{S}^2$ 2025

To replicate the figures for $\text{IC}^2\text{S}^2$ 2025:
```
python ic2s2_simulations.py
```
